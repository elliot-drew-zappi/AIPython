# AIPython

## Intro

I got sick of copy and pasting stuff into the ChatGPT website and back into my editor/terminal/whatever, so I have made a small python module using LangChain that I can use in the places I'm working most often - the python console or an python notebook.

## Installation

I'm hoping you can install this straight from git.
